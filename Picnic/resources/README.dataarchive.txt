This propertylist XML file describes the data available on the machine for an HSRL website, and some manners of processing
The file has 3 parts:

Instruments: Descriptions of Datastreams by instrument including:
   DataCatalog parser 'dataset' names (old C code, for matlab)
   imagesets prefixes for high-res archive images of the dataset (generated by crontab)
   thumbsets prefixes for low-res archive images of the dataset (generated by crontab)

Datasets: Simple table of locations of HSRL instrument-to-path mapping
   This is also duplicated in the hsrl_python codebase as the hsrl_python.json

Sites: Deployment site location descriptions
   Path of data, and a long name
   Time windows, so data outside identified times is ignored (assumed same insturment, but different site)
   Lat/Lon for other web interface features (satellite overpass, for example)
   Instrument list, directly mappable to the Instruments section of this file, in order to find what datas, images, and thumbsets are available for this site. Arguably the most important dynamicly configurable part of this file, leaving the web code to be very general to what is enclosed here.
